# 🔧 Render Export Fix - Bonnie Chat

## 🚨 **Issue Identified:**
Render build failing with `"default" is not exported by "src/BonnieChat.jsx"` error.

## ✅ **Root Cause:**
The BonnieChat component had the correct `export default function BonnieChat()` declaration, but the build system wasn't recognizing it properly.

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix:**

### Option 1: Verify Your BonnieChat.jsx Export (Recommended)
Make sure your `src/BonnieChat.jsx` file has this at line 391:

```jsx
export default function BonnieChat() {
  // ... rest of component
}
```

**NOT** at the end of the file:
```jsx
function BonnieChat() {
  // ... component code
}

export default BonnieChat; // ❌ Don't use this
```

### Option 2: Alternative Export Pattern
If the above doesn't work, you can use this pattern instead:

```jsx
function BonnieChat() {
  // ... all your component code here
}

export default BonnieChat;
```
