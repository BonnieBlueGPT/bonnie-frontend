## Integration Steps

```

### 2. Replace the Component
The `BonnieChat.jsx` file has been fully upgraded. Simply ensure it's in your `src` directory.

### 3. Test the Interface
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 4. Mobile Testing
1. Open the dev server on your mobile device
2. Test the following:
   - Message sending and receiving
   - Keyboard appearance/disappearance
   - Scroll behavior
   - Touch interactions
   - Landscape/portrait orientation

### 5. Production Build
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
